A unit test module for Phpfox plugins 

Because Phpfox doesn't go well with unit test because its singleton architecture, I define a small pattern to apply unit test on Phpfox. This project includes unit test for unit test module its self and for social ad module which is a product I am developing. For the demand of testing complex filter to target audience, unit test is a best choice for social ad module. 

This unit test module can be intalled normally as a PHpfox module and require Phpunit to be installed before using.
